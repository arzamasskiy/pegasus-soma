List of problem generator files in src/prob:

================================================================================
                              1-D problems
================================================================================

cpaw1d.c:
=========
Circularly Polarized Alfven Wave test.  This initializes only truly 1D
tests, that is wave must be in x1-direction only.

landau.c:
=========
Landau damping 

firehose1d.c:
=============
Undriven parallel (angle==0) and oblique (angle!=0) firehose instabilities. 

================================================================================
                              2-D problems
================================================================================

cpaw2d.c:
=========
Circularly Polarized Alfven Wave test.  Initializes wavevector at any
arbitrary angle to grid in 2D.

firehose.c:
===========
Undriven firehose instability in 2D.

mirror.c:
=========
Undriven mirror instability in 2D.

mri2d.c:
========
Net-flux and zero-net-flux axisymmetric magnetorotational instability.
